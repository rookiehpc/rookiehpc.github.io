# Contribute #

A guide to contribution is available in [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/rookiehpc/rookiehpc.github.io/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md), note however that this guide is still under construction. Nonetheless, eventually there will be proper tutorials explaining step by step how to add a new technology, a new documentation entry, modify an existing one and so on. This website has been entirely rewritten to allow contributions, hence the page editor, the hosting on Github Pages etc... So, efforts will also be made to make sure that the HPC passionates who would be willing to give a hand will be able to do so easily ;)

If you are trying to contribute and are a bit lost in the steps to do so, or if you have any question or feedback, please do not hesitate to reach out at [rookiehpc@outlook.com](mailto:rookiehpc@outlook.com).
