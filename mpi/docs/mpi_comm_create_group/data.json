    "Description":"MPI_Comm_create_group is similar to MPI_Comm_create but MPI_Comm_create_group requires only to be called by all processes in group, which is a subgroup of the group of the old communicator. On the other hand, MPI_Comm_create is a collective operation within the communicator comm because all processes of comm must call it. MPI_Comm_Create_Group returns a new communicator for which the group argument defines the communication group. Each process must provide a group when calling MPI_Comm_create_group, this can be MPI_GROUP_EMPTY, if all the groups are MPI_GROUP_EMPTY, then the call is erroneous. For a successful call, at least one group must be non-empty, all the processes of that group must call MPI_Comm_create_group with the same arguments and their groups must have the same ordering. The tag argument cannot be MPI_ANY_TAG.",
